			<h2 class="site_intent">Site Intent</h2>
				<p class="indent">The intent for this project is to redesign Epic Stoke's Website.</p>
				<p class="indent"><strong>Epic Stoke</strong> is a company created by two guys, Joe and Nick Schaeppi, from Maple Grove, Minnesota. They use 100% recycled billboard vinyl material to create their wallets. The goals of Epic Stoke and the company’s competitors are to make quality products and to help the environment and planet Earth. The goals for the company’s website include, attracting new and existing clients, increasing site traffic, and increasing product revenue. Currently, products and company-wise, new and existing clients are coming in and their product revenue and site traffic are increasing at a good pace. These goals are being met through their Kickstarter campaign site but not from their actual company site.</p>
				<p class="indent">The primary goal of the end-user is to buy quality products from our site. The goals that I want to achieve for the consumer/end-user for this site is to provide them with easy to use navigation to get from page to page in a timely manner. Also, to increase the amount of content into the following pages, Home, About, Contact, Shop, Product Information, and Get Stoked, which is their weekly newsletter section. We will focus the content and graphics to meet the targeted audiences’ attention and interest. Having the attention and interests of the targeted audience will help increase the opportunity to convince them why this product is beneficial to them and why they are making the right choice when purchasing the wallets from us. The site is not currently meeting these goals.</p>
				<p class="indent">Some ways that our project design and development will aid in the above goals is first, creating a visually appealing site. As of now, the site has really bright yellows and huge text. I would like to bring in colors that are more associated with the wallets and to size down the text so that a little bit more informative and useful content can be placed on the page but to where it is still easily seen/readable. With the development portion of the site I would like to clean up the markup a bit. As of now, the CSS is mixed in with the HTML. I need to separate this because this is not good practice. The presentation should be separate from the structure/markup. I will achieve this by having separate files of validated HTML5 and CSS3.</p>

			<p class="indent">These sites are drawing in a demographic that I would like to tap into along with the demographic that the site has already had. These competitor sites are mostly tapping into a demographic of older males and females. I am looking to tap into that audience as well as for a younger crowd. Currently visitors are spending more time on our client sites than some of these competitors. Epic Stoke currently does not have keywords listed when referencing alexa.com, so yes, the competitors are using keywords that I need to target as well along with new ones like billboard vinyl, wallets, epic, stoke, surf, extreme sports, etc.</p>
			<p>There are some bad practices that are holding back our client’s site like having bad use of their structural and presentational markup and lack of keywords for SEO marketing. Our competitors are also participating in bad practices when it comes to getting their name out there with the use of SEOs. </p>

The following user personas will help to maximize the user experience when developing the new user interface by implementing a user-centered approach.</p>
